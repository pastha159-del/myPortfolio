                The reason I am who I am today is my family and friends. I grew up in a joint family where every member shaped me in their own way—my dad taught me to take calculated risks, my brother showed me the power of trying, my sister sparked my creativity, and my sister-in-law taught me to be grounded while staying true to myself. My mom instilled the importance of independence, my grandmother keeps me humble, and every other family member has helped me grow confident in my own skin. They are the comfort and back bone of my life.
