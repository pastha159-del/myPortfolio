            <p>
                Life as an international student has been a mix of adventures and lessons. From night outs with friends to learning to cook from scratch just to survive, doing laundry on my day off, and grinding at work—helping customers and learning the value of responsibility—I’ve experienced what it means to be on my own. I spend my earnings on groceries, attend classes not just to learn but to meet friends and build connections, and navigate daily life with curiosity and grit. Even with the comfort and support I’ve talked about before, these moments remind me what it truly means to stand on my own two feet.
